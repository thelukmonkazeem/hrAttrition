# HR Attrition using Power BI

My recent data project on HR attrition using Power BI focused on understanding and mitigating employee turnover in organizations. 

By analyzing factors such as job involvement, job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and environment satisfaction, I gained valuable insights into the causes of attrition.

I gathered the HR attrition dataset from Kaggle, a platform that provides datasets for data enthusiasts. 

After cleaning and organizing the data, I created various measures and built a data model to establish relationships between tables. Using Power BI's visualization capabilities, I presented the analysis findings through charts and graphs.

The analysis revealed that the attrition rate was **16.12%**, with the highest number of employees leaving falling between **31-40** years of age. 

Male employees constituted the majority of attrition cases. 

Employees with less than five years of experience and those in entry-level positions had higher attrition rates. 

Additionally, job involvement, job satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction were identified as significant contributors to attrition.
